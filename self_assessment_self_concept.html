For me, 17 was the age that started my journey through adulthood. I am 33 now, and in all this time, I have looked for meaning in my life. During this time I have found one thing to be true; life is a series of communication threads that form the web of my reality.
<p>
Although I could never articulate the word until now, Semiotics has dominated that existence. As I listen to someone tell me about their life experiences, I have always studied the signs. This brings me to why 17 was such a significant age for me. 
<p>
During that time, I dropped out of high-school. Right after that, my family and I were evicted from our home. Both events affected my self-esteem, but not for the better. My decision to drop out of school was predicated on the fact that I needed and wanted control over some aspect of my life. In turn I should have used that same logic to rectify that mistake as soon as I made it.
<p>
For a couple of years, I did nothing about it. The fact is, I had fallen in with a group of friends, who like me lacked a clear direction. Instead of encouraging each other to succeed, we enabled each other to maintain the status quo. 
<p>
A random encounter with someone who lived through a situation that mirrored mine exactly, lead me to the realization that I owed it to myself to fulfill my potential. I took that encounter, along seeing all my friends getting into trouble with the law one-by-one, as a sign. I would be a fool if I didn’t see the signs and find meaning in that. 
<p>
The book states, that “Meaning is modiﬁed through an interpretive process.” In order to survive I had to extract meaning from every encounter, every word and every action of others, then transform it. For years, I have lived by the creed of ‘learn from others’ mistakes and experiences’. This is who I am, this is my ‘self-concept’; it is my ability to see who I was, who I am, and who I could be, by extracting the meaning of life’s symbols and internalizing it.
<p>
With that in mind, I began the process of fixing a mistake I had made. I returned to school finish my high-school diploma and start community college. Eventually, I went as far as I was financially able to go. Again, seeing the struggle and experiences of others my age and older, I knew I couldn’t quit moving forward. The Navy offered me a way to do something with meaning, and would also help me continue my journey of growth and self-discovery. 
<p>
My uncle had once told me that he almost joined the Navy many years ago, but backed out last second. He said he had always regretted not having the courage to go through with it. I wasn’t going to make that mistake, even if I had doubted my ability to do it. I signed on the dotted line in September 2009 at age 27. 
<p>
The Theory of Symbolic Interaction states that people act based on the symbolic meanings that are communicated in a given situation. This holds true for me. I have shaped my life around this theory. I just didn’t realize it until now.

<h1>Corey Hensley, The Student Behind the Resume</h1>
<br>
Corey Hensley was born October 16, 1981 in Farmington Hills, Michigan to parents Gregory and Leslie Hensley. He was raised with both his parents in the township of Redford until the age of 10 when his parents divorced. Shortly thereafter he went and lived with his father. For the remainder of this childhood he would live on and off with both his parents never really feeling like he could be content with either of them.
<p>
Just before his seventeenth birthday, Corey dropped out of high school and got a full-time job to help support his family after his mother lost her home. Over time he began to regret giving up on his education; it was this mistake that would ultimately drive him forward later on. At 20 years-old Corey went back to school full time while also maintaining a full-time job. In 2003, three years after he was supposed have graduated, Corey received his high school diploma and was given the honor of speaking in front of his graduating class.
<p>
During his speech he said:
<p>
<i>"There are going to be many times in life where you are heading down the wrong road and you start to feel like you are spinning out of control. It's never too late to pull over and take a breath. It's never too late to course-correct. And when you do those along the way, whether they be family, friends or complete strangers will be there to welcome you back."</i>
<p>
After graduation, Corey quickly set to work on his associate's degree, enrolling in Schoolcraft Community College. In 2008 Corey acquired his degree in Liberal Arts. It was another long road, working two, sometimes three, jobs to help pay for his education and support himself.
<p>
Corey found himself at a crossroads; he would not be able to afford tuition at a University but also felt he could not stay where he was. He had to keep going, he had to keep pushing himself. So a year after getting his degree, Corey joined the United State Navy.
<p>
2009 marked a turning point in his life. He was now a service member of the armed forces. After completing boot camp, he was selected to become a Mass Communication Specialist; his job would require him to use photography, journalism, design and social media to tell the Navy's story. In his seven years of service he was stationed in Maryland, Guam, and Italy and journeyed to places throughout Europe, Africa and Asia. But it was in Italy that Corey honed his skills and developed a passion for digital design, web development and social media. This led to him making the decision to separate from the Navy in August 2016 and pursue his bachelor's in Interactive Digital Media at Drexel University and his next milestone.

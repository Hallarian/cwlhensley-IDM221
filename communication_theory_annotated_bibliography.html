The journey of learning about Communication Theory has the power to yield various personal revelations about one’s own self. Learning about discussing the nuances about these theories has brings to light behavioral patterns that people engage in without any personal awareness. Social exchange theory (SET) is one such communication theory and that has become a primary focus of this assignment.
<p>
On its surface, it is simplistic in nature. However it is in fact complex and posits that there is something else going on below the surface. The theory asks us to think about our personal and professional relationships in economic terms weigh the cost versus the rewards of these personal engagements. The applications of SET are far-reaching. Making a decision to act one way or another can have a domino effect, an action which leads to new choices, with each one have a potential psychological effect. It is begging us to understand that everything you do, can be balanced with two simple words; yes and no. It will be interesting to see how it relates to, and affects and is affected by an individual’s personal growth. The goal is to find a correlation to social exchange theory and a person’s overall development.
<p>
By coming to understand why we have participated in certain behavioral patterns, we also understand the outcomes of various personal and professional relationships throughout our lives. If we hope to understand who we are underneath, we must first peel back the layer of SET and further explore the theories applications.

This article discusses the application of resource control theory and SET, with a focus on linking social networking in school children with relational aggression. Neal & Cappella (2012) suggest that “Children who engage in relational aggression often have instrumental goals of advancing their own access to social and material resources” [Adler and Adler, 1995; Heilbron and Prinstein, 2008; J.W. Neal, 2010a]. Their theory postulates that in some cases social exchange may further exacerbate relational aggression (Neal & Cappella, 2012). It is of interest that those who are denied social exchanges or dependent on aggressor for social exchanges, ignore the cost-reward system for social acceptance. This violation of SET reinforces the attitude of the aggressor making for a toxic relationship. Neal & Cappella (2012) suggest,
that the association between children’s number of relationships and related aggression will be moderated by their affiliation with poorly connected peers. Specifically, children who have more peer relationships will exhibit higher levels of relational aggression when, on average, these relationships are with peers who have fewer relationships themselves (pg. 128).

This resource was helpful in that any further studies may suggest that there is a correlation between SET, relational aggression and persons overall development.

This article discusses how research on human emotion can elaborate and improve upon SET, with a focus on illustrating how the ideas of psychology and sociology may alter the context, process and outcome social exchange in networks or groups. Lawler and Thye suggest that self-interest and interdependence are a crucial piece of social exchange and that how emotion play an integral role in SET. They surmise that ignoring emotions when dealing with social exchanges is flawed in that many choices are usually made in a heightened emotional state. They concluded that the sociology of both emotions and exchange are very distinct. And though it raises many more questions than it answers, it can “reveal a multitude of theoretical junctures at which emotional phenomena can complement, deepen, or broaden exchange theorizing and research” (Lawler & Thye, pg. 238).
<p>
This is very be true as emotions play a key role in relationship choices. Our emotional state has to factor into cost-reward system of SET, in that what we are willing to endure of peace of mind.

This article discusses the study of the attitudes of rural residents toward the tourism industry. Focus was to investigate this from a social psychological perspective, taking into consideration factors such the frequency and quality of the interactions. In keeping with the themes of social exchange theory, it was found that those who had a financial stake in local tourism acted more positively toward the industry. Chaung concluded that rural tourism was looked upon more positively than mainstream tourism, because of a variant of perceptions such as economic, sociocultural and environmental impacts. “Our finding provide support for the claim that rural tourism should be a good choice for residents trying to preserve rural landscapes, lifestyles, and culture, and wanting to promote agricultural development” (Chuang, pg. 1321).
<p>
This study does little to assist in the endeavor to find out how the deep the effects of social exchange theory can have on the development of an individual. Further, if one were to look deeper into his theory they would come up with several inconsistencies based on the vast cultural differences of Taiwan and the United States.

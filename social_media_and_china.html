<b>Abstract</b><br>
<div>The communist government China has a history of censorship in the form of violent acts against its people. For example the notorious incident at Tiananmen Square. Today, in the age of the Internet when everyone is connected and everyone is watching, the government’s tactics are changing to adapt to world-wide media saturation. New government policies have included strict media controls like systems monitoring, firewall creation, shutting down publications or websites. In some cases the government has so far as to imprison those found guilty of being rebellious journalists, bloggers, and activists. However, China’s communist party is fighting a losing battle in the war against social media, and what social media could mean for China.</div>

<h2>Social Media and China: Why Censorship Will Fail</h2>
<p>
Twenty-six years ago a tragic event in China’s history occurred. Pro-democracy protestors gathered in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, thus beginning a demonstration that would last for weeks (CNN 2015). Eventually the government ordered in armed troops and tanks to quell the rebellious protestors. As the situation escalated, troops began firing on the crowd; the official number of those killed has never been released by the government but speculative numbers range from the hundreds to the thousands (CNN, 2015).
<p>
And therein lies the point: China’s government has history of distorting and outright suppressing facts, and media. Just days before the massacre, there was a total media blackout of American news telecasts in Beijing, with photography and videotaping of the demonstrations and the Chinese troops forbidden (CNN, 2015). In 2009 on the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre, the government, again blocked foreign news agencies and social media sites in an attempt to stop its people from recognizing this historical even. It seems when it comes to this tragedy, the government’s policy is to make its people forget.
<p>

<b>Stated Case</b><br>
As social media has become this unstoppable force, China continues efforts to regulate and control the signal in an effort prevent influence from outside cultures that could cause dissent and a potential shift toward democratic thinking among the people. What’s interesting is that as the Chinese economy grows, trying to prevent the rise of democracy in its country becomes a futile effort. As the world itself becomes more connected, the flow of information and ideas becomes more easily accessed through the Internet. Combining the ease to the access to information and China’s socio economic growth, staying a communist country will not be a viable option. Because of economic grow, the government will have to adapt to western ideals order to ensure the future prosperity for its people.    
<p>

<b>Proposition</b><br>
Despite a recent slowdown, China’s economy continues to grow, and now has the largest economy in the world, causing the United States to concede that honor for the first time since Ulysses S. Grant was president. (Worstall, 2015). The rapid growth of the country’s middle-class could be a potential factor that could lead to the end of censorship and will be something to keep an eye on in the next few years. Sheet economics tells us that if we apply what we know to be true in the United States, a strong middle class leads to a strong economy then by that reasoning an increase in the middle class in Chinas will lead to more spending due to increased wages, further fueling the economy.
<p>
A lot of the products that have been and will continue to be purchased are smart devices, such as phones, tablets, laptops, etc. In a recent quarterly sales figure by Apple, points out that iPhone sales in China had surpassed United States sales for the first time (William Pesek, 2015). Pesek speculates that perhaps China has reached what he calls the “Henry Ford Moment” in their economic growth, where the people are finally able to buy a lot of the goods they are manufacturing, (para. 1).
<p>
The surge in smart device sales has allowed more than ever for the government has access to the thoughts and beliefs of its people. But China’s censorship approach is like a dam holding back a flood of information and that information is starting to seep through. In the past, the government has told the Chinese people what they can read, shaping minds and forcing what they believed would lead to prosperity as a culture. It’s the breakaway of this ideology that the people at Tiananmen Square were protesting for and what social media could help achieve. As a person gains the means to voice his or her opinion, and as those means grow to reach a wider audience, it becomes harder for any government to silence; especially if we consider that the voice it is trying to silence, becomes the voice of masses.
<p>

<b>Refutation</b><br>
Some would argue that censorship in China is effective and even welcomed. Liz Tung (2013) recalls a passage from the memoir, Apologies to My Censor, by reporter Mitch Moxley, who had spent some time working for an English language newspaper in China:
<p>
"When I arrived in Beijing, I wanted life at China Daily to be crazy, movie-premise crazy, communist spies leaning over my shoulder, filtered e-mails, phone taps and threatening late-night altercations with men in Mao suits. In my imagination, I would be a fly on the wall and expose the massive state propaganda apparatus from within" (para. 3).
<p>
Tung (2015) says the reality for Moxley was much different as he discovered that the censorship taking place was more Kafka-eques than Stalinist, “comprising a humdrum series of last-minute deletions and substitutions based on the political whim of an editor or a dictate from the Propaganda Department (para. 3).
<p>
Tung’s logic here is that the people practice self-censorship. Reinforcing this claim is a report from the Council on Foreign Relations by Beina Xu (2015) who says that many Chinese media outlets are employing monitors to ensure political acceptability of content they produce, and circulating weekly censorship guidelines from the Communist Party. What both authors fail to realize or are trying to conceal is the fact that people are self-censoring for fear of reprisal from the government or others that have a personal stake in the success of the Communist Party. The government has the people living in a constant state of fear and paranoia.
<p>
The government also continues to limit information technologies that could be harmful to their agenda even as their own people attempt to bypass this censorship. The spread of social media around the world and the continued bombardment of outside influences that we see the cracks in the censorship firewall China has created.
<p>

<b>Substantiation and Proof</b><br>
If we look at China’s current social media practices, it is becoming more difficult for the government to conceal and manipulate facts for its own agenda, and even more strenuous to control and monitor what its people say and think: but still they try. Lotus Ruan (2015) states that, “unlike Twitter, WhatsApp and many other social media applications where users could open an account with an email address or a phone number, China has launched various crusades to enforce a real-name registration system to manage its Internet” (para. 5). What this tactic ensures is that the government can keep tabs on who is saying what.
<p>
We also see examples of keywords in searches being banned as Internet users receive "page cannot be displayed" when looking up subjects such as " One-party dictatorship," " Chinese Spring " or " Beijing massacred " (Engel 2014). The government has also banned quite a bit of famous social media platforms such as Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Google. But they have also had to allow for the birth of their own platforms, such as the Chinese microblogging service, Weibo. This service, which is essentially an amalgamation of Facebook and Twitter, has seen a reported 198 million monthly active users with a majority coming from mobile devices, and 89 million active users daily according Zaw Thiha Tun, (2015). The company is forecasting that in fiscal year 2015, it will see a 350 percent growth rate (Tun 2015).
<p>
Looking at figure 2, we can see that China’s government are still doubling down on their efforts to censor what they perceive as harmful to their rule. 
<p>
There is a spike during the time surrounding the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre; in fact there is a spike during times of protest as the government tries to limit attention these events receive. There is no greater example of this then on September 28, 2014, when thousands of people gathered in Hong Kong’s Civic Square for a pro-democracy movement. The reasons for the government's censorship on this day are simple: to stop the spread of dissent amongst its people.
<p>

<b>Conclusion</b><br>
China, being an authoritarian society, leaves little room for a lot of personal freedoms, such as free speech. Instead, the country relies heavily on propaganda and the ideological control of its government. At least that is how it was before the Internet. Before this, people were merely passengers when it came to social content by reading the newspaper, listening to radio or watching television; this was the equivalent of a one-way conversation and it was up each individual to discern the messages that were being generated. Today, most of us have a participatory relationship with media that allows us to be in the driver’s seat and take part in the conversation and even be content creators. As we become more and more connected it will be harder and harder for the “China’s Great Firewall” to sustain itself (Foreign Policy, 2015).

  <h1>Documentation Inspiration</h1>

By Corey Hensley, IDM 221-002

<h2>Website One: IGN.com</h2>

IGN.com is a fun, informative and well structured site that gives its visitors a vast amount of content.
<p>
<h3>Pros about IGN</h3>
<ul>
<li>The various categories are well thought out and organized.
<li>Links for the each category are located in more than one location, making finding content much easier.
</ul>
<h3>Cons about IGN</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pop up advertisements can become annoying
<li>Sometimes article backgrounds don't load, which causes the site's graphical background image to blend into the an article's content making the information harder to read.
</ul>
</li>
<p>
IGN.com is an aggregator and creator of news related content, guides and reviews of all the things I am interested in, film, television video games and various tech devices. It presents all its a content in a sleek, engaging package.

<h2>Website Two: Boxofficemojo.com</h2>

Boxofficemojo.com is a simple, content oriented site that contains finanical statistics about films and the overall box office.

<h3>Pros about Box Office Mojo</h3>
<ul>
<li>Box Office Moho is all about the content, and the content categories and sub categories are vast.
<li>The site has a simple user interface design.
</ul>
<h3>Cons about Box Office Mojo</h3>
<ul>
<li>The site's design is just a little too simple. It could use a little polish.
<li>It's surprising that there isn't a lot more news about the industry. Stats are fine but if the site had more industry content, the frequency of visitors to the site would increase.
</ul>
</li>
<p>
Boxofficemojo.com has been around for years and it's design has never changed. This site inspires me to think of ways to redesign its user interface and add more content.

<h2>Website Three: Headhunterhairstyling.com</h2>

Headhunterhairstyling.com appears to have had a couple of redesigns, and the latest hasn't gotten much better.

<h3>Pros about Headhunter Hair Styling</h3>
<ul>
<li>There isn't much to like about this site, save for the logo. It has potential.
</ul>
<h3>Cons about the Headhunting Hair Styling</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most of the imagery is low resolution, and ones that aren't look like they are stock imagery from the internet;
<li>The image slider on the home page is far bigger than it needs to be, and the fade to white is cliche.
<li>The color palettes used for this site are not at all complimentary to each other and don't really convey the sleekness needed for this type of establishment.
<li>The Services page is actually using clip art; this makes for a tacky display.
<li>And why is a blog needed for this site?
</ul>
</li>
<p>
This site does almost everything wrong when it comes to concepts and rules of design. There is a possibility that customers who visit this will be turned off from this business. It would almost be better if they didn't have a site at all.
